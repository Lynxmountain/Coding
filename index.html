            What is my favorite Hobby and what is it about?
        </b>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        My favorite hobby is Coding. Coding is the process of writing out a set of
        instuctions or scripts that can be read by various computers and computer programs.
        After creating a script you can execute it and the software will read it and 
        run the instructions given within the script. An example of a line of code within a script
        would be <mark style="background-color: rgb(50,50,50);"><strong style="color: rgb(255,150,255); font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">System.out.println("Hello world")</strong></mark>. This is a line of Java code that will
        print out the string "Hello world".

            How Often do I do this Hobby?
        </b>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        I code very often, sometimes, every day of the week. I have many large 
        code projects that I do and although I dont finish many of them, I do
        get a good bit along on them. My main problem with some of my projects 
        is actually that I spend so much time working on them that I get bored of them.

            Why do I enjoy this Hobby?
        </b>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">
        I enjoy this Hobby because I consider it to be fun and it makes me happy. Another reason
        I enjoy it is because it sometimes makes me think a bit harder and gets my brain working a 
        little more. I also enjoy it because It gives me something to do to occupy my time and makes 
        me feel a little accomplishment when I finish a project. Another reason I like Coding is that
        it makes me happy when I can make something for other people to enjoy.
